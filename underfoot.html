								<p>I named this article underfoot since the process of building out the subfloor and floor got in our way for longer than expected. Nonetheless, we learned a ton in the process and are excited to have the first component in that makes the van feel like a home!</p>
								<p>We decided to forego framing on the floor to avoid drilling extra holes in our metal frame and save on some weight and space. Instead, we opted for 1/2" XPS foam board as support between the ribs, a solid 1” XPS board above for insulation, and then 3/4" plywood on top as our subfloor. This meant there was a TON of caulking involved, which I have decided is my least favorite construction task. In a correlate to Murphy’s law, everything adhesive can get on it will get on.</p>
								<p>The first step was measuring out the ribs. We are quickly learning that nothing in the van is symmetrical or consistent and you cannot make any assumptions. So, we were very thorough on our measurements. Since the 1” XPS is resting on the 1/2” XPS ribs rather than the metal ribs (which is better for insulation!), we decided to make the ribs wider where we could by routing out the bottom in certain spots, thus allowing them to rest flush even with bumps underneath. As you can tell from the picture, making sure we routed in the right places takes a bit of thought and self-correction!</p>

								<p>During this process we also had to make some decisions about where our subfloor would end. Instead of extending the subfloor as long as we could, we left the spare tire access point open in the back. We also decided to build a nice transition into the cabin to prevent trips and stubbed toes; TBD on how this will go later. Lastly, we got the ribs very well secured to the van floor with Loctite (which my Dad did need to do a mid-install Lowe’s run for due to our higher-than-expected consumption rate). To add to the excitement, the Loctite exploded in the electric caulk gun and I had to switch to the manual caulk gun for a while. After this experience, my forearms are quite grateful that my Dad has an electric caulk gun.</p>

								</div>
								<p>We then scribed the van wall shapes onto the 1” XPS to cover the whole floor in three separate pieces. We cut these out, checked the fit, and repeated the process with our plywood sheets. These cuts gave us perfect excuses to get some practice in with the table saw and the circular saw. In two rounds of applying Loctite and curing, we got both levels glued.</p>

								<p>The plywood required an extra step, biscuit joining! We first dry fit the sheets and marked exactly where we wanted to place our biscuits which help to create a strong and stable join between each sheet. We used the biscuit joiner to cut insets. Then, during the already rushed installation with Loctite drying, we also put wood glue and biscuits in the insets and squeezed our boards into place. Goodbye to my carefully rust-prevention painted floor and hello to a (mostly) level surface!</p>

								</div>
								<p>To prevent water from getting into our subfloor, we then used gaps and cracks to fill around the edges. We each took our turn, and let’s just say our relative skill levels were apparent.</p>

								</div>
								<p>At this point, we got to choose what type of floor we wanted. We originally thought we would do a peel and stick vinyl sheet flooring to create a waterproof seal. However, we were convinced by a lovely local shop owner to go with luxury vinyl planks. While not adding much more cost-wise, these planks are a lot more durable, provide additional sound deadening, are easy to install, look better, and give a more waterproof seal. It took a bit to figure out, but we ended up finding one we liked that had a rigid core (ISOCORE rather than the heavier traditional rigid core, stone plastic composite). This ensures we won’t have our floor buckling with expansion and contraction under extreme temperature changes, from baking in Arizona’s desert to freezing in Seattle ski trips. We started the scribing and cuts to get the first row of planks laid down. This took a couple hours to do right but should be smooth sailing from here. Stay tuned for how the full floor looks!</p>
